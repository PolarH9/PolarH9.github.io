            <h3>Circles (Post Malone - Pop)</h3>
            <p>The intro gives a very chill vibe that is felt throughout the song but after adding Post Malone's vocals with the instrumentals, it gives the song more of a "looking out your car window while on a roadtrip" kind of vibe which I like and it makes this song one of my favorite songs to listen while driving.</p>

            <h3>Blinding Lights (The Weekend - Synth-pop)</h3>
            <p>The weekend has a unique style of music as he tends to use synths throughout his songs as the main melody. In this song you hear synths throughout and they are very catchy, which makes this one of my favorite song from him. This is also just a good sond to listen while driving.</p>

            <h3>Passionfruit (Drake - Hip-hop)</h3>
            <p>This song is one of my favorites because it gives me some nostalgia from when I first heard this song in middle school. This song has a very calm vibe and it makes me just close my eyes and just relax to this song. Not only is the beat very chill it is aslo catchy.</p>

            <h3>SICKO MODE (Travis Scott - Hip-hop)</h3>
            <p>In my opinion one of the best Hip-Hop song to ever be released. Not only is it made by Houston native Travis Scott, but it also includes one of the biggest artist right now in Drake. My favorite thing about this song is the suddent beat change in the middle of the song which then includes a verse by Drake with a completely different flow from Travis scott along the new beat. That makes this song very memorable and unique to me.</p>

            <h3>Last Dance (Eve - Japanese Rock)</h3>
            <p>What I really like about this song is that since it's in Japanese, you tend to focus more on the instrumentals in the song. In the beginning of the song you are introduced with an electric guitar solo that is very catchy and you hear that solo throughout the song in the background. Altough you can't understand the volcals they are catchy and go very well with the instrumentals. </p>

            <h3>505 (Artic Monkeys - Indie Rock)</h3>
            <p>I wasn't a big fan of this song when I first listened to it, but after listening to it more times it become one of my favorite songs. This song starts slow but it slowly builds up to a very explosive ending where everything comes together. This song also has a very catchy electric guitar solo that is heard throughout the song.</p>

            <h3>Ladders (Mac Miller - Hip-hop)</h3>
            <p>I like how this song goes from a chill vibe to chill vibe with rapping then more instrumentals are introduced that makes you bop your head to this song. The lyrics are also relateble but the beats and flow help make this to a great song.</p>

            <h3>90210 (Travis Scott - Hip-hop)</h3>
            <p>Another from Travis Scott but this is way different and similar to SICKO MODE. Both have beat changes in the middle of their songs that completely change the vibes of the songs. Listening to this song gives me familiar vibes to Passionfruit where I can just close my eyes and vibe to the song. Travis' flow towards the end of the song is also very good and it makes this song whole. </p>

            <h3>Hotel California (Eagles - Rock)</h3>
            <p>As you probably can already tell guitars are one of my favorite instrumentals to listen in a song. This song has a very chill guitar melody and a great electric guitar solo towards the end that is very iconic. This is a classic rock song that you can just vibe to.</p>

            <h3>Stairway to Heaven (Led Zepagain - Progressive Rock)</h3>
            <p>This song is very iconic and although is very long compared to my other favorite songs, it builds up to a great ending where everything comes together and you get rewarded for listening to the end. It has great electric guitar instrumentals throughout the whole song that help make the song what it is. The drum instrumentals that come later in the song help elevate the song and change it.</p>
